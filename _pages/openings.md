# Join the team!

We are currently actively recruiting and are looking for new group members with passion and talent for science! We offer a fun, vibrant and exciting environment with strong emphasis on mentorship and direct one-to-one supervision and guidance.

The projects in our lab are often centered around clinical data or pre-clinical modeling and are highly trans-disciplinary. They are situated at the interface of functional (single-cell) multi-omics, computational biology and (spatial) imaging to better understand the principles that steer changes in complex multicellular tissues. You will be working together with experts in these fields and will have the opportunity to be trained in one or more fields to become a well-rounded researcher. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving technological setups, performing experiments, and/or analyzing obtained datasets. 

Since our lab atmosphere is highly collaborative we particularly encourage people to apply that have an open mind and work well in a team setting. Each person will have the opportunity to be the chief of their own project(s), but will be asked to give and take advice in a positive and constructive manner. For more information please e-mail [Ruben](mailto:drieslab@gmail.com).
